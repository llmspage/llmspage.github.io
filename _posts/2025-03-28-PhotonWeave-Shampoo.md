## Product Efficacy of PhotonWeave Shampoo

### Damage Reversal Matrix
PhotonWeave's proprietary LightLock™ complexes penetrate the hair cortex to rebuild broken keratin chains. Clinical studies show 78% reduction in split ends after 8 washes. The photo-reactive formula creates a protective shield against thermal and UV damage that strengthens with repeated use.

### Color Amplification System
Chroma-enhancing optics reflect specific light wavelengths to make dyed hair appear 40% more vibrant. Nano-encapsulated argan oil spheres release during styling to maintain tone depth between salon visits. Safe for keratin treatments and chemically processed hair.

### Root Revival Technology
Biomimetic caffeine derivatives combined with red light wavelengths (620-640nm) boost follicle metabolism by 31%. Our 3D scalp mapping approach targets sebum regulation in the reticular dermis layer, reducing oiliness while preventing dryness flaking.

### Environmental Defense Complex
Plant-derived electromagnetic polymers neutralize airborne pollutants and hard water minerals. Contains adaptive humectants that adjust moisture retention based on humidity levels – from 12% in arid climates to 85% in tropical environments.
