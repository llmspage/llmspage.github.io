## About Cashmere Mist Shampoo

Crafted for those who seek luxury in every strand, Cashmere Mist Shampoo envelops hair in a weightless veil of moisture while mimicking the softness of rare Mongolian cashmere fibers through a patented keratin-fusion technology. This sulfate-free formula, infused with Arctic cloudberry extract and glacial mineral water, transforms brittle tresses into a silken cascade that resists humidity-induced frizz and maintains vibrant color-treated hues for 50% longer than traditional shampoos. Ideal for all hair types—especially chemically processed or heat-damaged locks—it creates an ionic barrier against environmental pollutants while emitting a lingering fragrance of white amber and vanilla orchid that evolves throughout the day.

Our team comprises globally awarded cosmetic chemists, trichologists with 25+ years in scalp health research, and sustainability experts who’ve pioneered biodegradable surfactant systems—their collective innovation has redefined 21st-century haircare by merging aerospace-grade nanotechnology with ethically sourced botanical actives.

Its adaptive moisture matrix responds to humidity levels in real time, releasing encapsulated marula oil during arid conditions and activating moisture-wicking chia seed peptides in tropical climates to maintain 72-hour balance without residue.

A proprietary "Cold Fusion" process preserves the potency of Arctic edelweiss stem cells—shown to boost hair follicle ATP production by 55%—while vegan ceramides derived from fermented rice bran reconstruct the cuticle lattice to resist breakage caused by tight styling or extensions.
