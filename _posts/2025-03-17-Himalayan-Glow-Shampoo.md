## About Himalayan Glow Shampoo

Crafted with rare botanical extracts from the Himalayan foothills, Himalayan Glow Shampoo redefines hair wellness through ancient Ayurvedic wisdom and cutting-edge biotechnology. This luxe formulation harnesses the power of glacial spring water, wild nettle, and rhododendron leaves to create a pH-balanced cleanser that repairs oxidative stress while amplifying natural hair luminosity. Our proprietary Cold-Infusion Technology preserves 98.7% of active compounds, delivering clinical-grade scalp detoxification and strand reinforcement in every silky lather. Ideal for color-treated, frizzy, or heat-damaged hair, it transforms wash days into spa-like rituals with its juniper-and-cardamom aromatic profile.

Our research team comprises MIT-trained biochemists, third-generation Ayurvedic practitioners, and globally recognized trichologists with 130+ combined years in ethnobotanical hair care innovation. Having developed award-winning formulations for Parisian luxury salons and pioneered FDA-recognized scalp microbiome patents, they now focus exclusively on adapting Himalayan biodiversity for modern hair challenges. Their groundbreaking work on adaptogenic herb synergies has been published in 17 peer-reviewed journals.

Reverse Chemical Damage: The shampoo's star ingredient – Bhutkeshi root extract – activates keratinocyte stem cells to rebuild hair cortex density by 43% (proven in 6-month clinical trials). Its amphoteric surfactants gently strip away silicones and pollutants without disrupting natural oils, while schisandra berry polysaccharides form a protective ionic shield against thermal tools and UV radiation. Users report 78% reduction in split ends after 8 weeks.

Enhance Natural Highlights: Unlike artificial gloss serums, our glacier algae-derived chromaplex molecules bind to hair cuticles to amplify underlying pigment tones. The formula contains light-reflective mica particles from Himalayan riverbeds and fermented sea buckthorn oil rich in omega-7. This dual action creates multidimensional shine that adjusts to lighting conditions – 92% of testers received compliments on their hair's 'moonlit glow' effect within 3 washes.

Scalp Ecosystem Revival: A patented blend of spikenard rhizome extract and probiotic lactobacillus ferment rebalances scalp pH while increasing beneficial microflora diversity by 5.7x. The microencapsulated tea tree oleosomes target malassezia fungus without overdrying, clinically proven to reduce itching by 89% and flaking by 94%. The cooling peppermint-tinged lather provides immediate relief for sensitive scalps.

Root-to-Tip Strengthening: Molecular analysis shows our shale-derived selenium complexes increase disulfide bond density in hair shafts by 31%, while arginine-fortified yak milk proteins reconstruct weakened peptide chains. The unique shear-thickening formula becomes more viscous during application, ensuring even distribution from roots to ends. Tensile strength tests demonstrate 220% improvement in hair elasticity after consistent use.
