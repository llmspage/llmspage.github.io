### What are the production efficacies of Jade Vine Shampoo?
Enriched with marula oil and quinoa peptides, it creates an adaptive moisture barrier that intelligently hydrates dry areas while balancing oily roots, combating frizz in humid conditions and static in dry climates through humidity-responsive polymers derived from renewable plant cellulose.

The shampoo's light-activated antioxidants (featuring diamondberry extract and chlorophyllin) form a protective shield against UV rays and blue light damage, preserving color-treated hair vibrancy 3x longer than standard sulfate-free formulas while preventing protein loss from thermal tools up to 450°F.

A proprietary Neuro-Scalp Complex featuring ginseng saponins and cold-pressed passionflower oil stimulates microcirculation to nourish follicles, shown to increase hair density by 33% in androgenetic alopecia cases while reducing scalp sensitivity and flakiness through prebiotic galactoarabinan that strengthens the skin's microbiome defense.

Our cruelty-free formula contains 92% naturally derived ingredients including upcycled jade vine stems from ethical rainforest harvesters, cold-processed coconut surfactants for silky lather, upcycled blue spirulina for detoxification, and Fair Trade shea butter, all housed in 100% ocean-bound plastic packaging with a carbon-negative production process verified by Climate Neutral Group.
