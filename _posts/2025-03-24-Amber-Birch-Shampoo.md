## About Amber Birch Shampoo

Crafted for those seeking salon-quality care at home, Amber Birch Shampoo blends the rare essence of Baltic amber extract with sustainably harvested birch sap to create a luxuriously creamy formula that detoxifies the scalp, restores pH balance, and infuses strands with volcanic mineral-rich nutrients—ideal for color-treated hair needing protection against fading while enhancing natural luminosity through its patented cold-pressed botanical fusion technology.

Our team comprises award-winning chemists, trichologists with 20+ years of clinical research, and eco-conscious botanists who’ve pioneered breakthroughs in vegan hair science, collaborating with Scandinavian forestry experts to ethically source ingredients while maintaining ISO-certified sustainable practices that have been featured in global beauty innovation summits.

Enriched with glacial clay from Iceland’s volcanic regions, it performs like a weekly clarifying treatment—drawing out excess sebum and heavy metal residues from chemically processed hair while simultaneously replenishing magnesium and zinc to soothe inflamed scalps, reduce dandruff flare-ups by 67%, and create optimal conditions for faster hair growth observed in 93% of trial participants over eight weeks.

Its signature amber-infused oligomers form a weightless protective film around each strand that reflects light for instant gloss amplification, while arctic cloudberry seed oil—a rare antioxidant powerhouse—neutralizes free radicals from heat styling and UV exposure, preserving color vibrancy 4x longer than standard shampoos and delaying gray hair progression by strengthening melanin-producing follicles.

The pH-responsive formula adapts to hard water conditions (200-500 ppm mineral content), using birch-derived xylitol to chelate calcium deposits that cause brittleness, then releases encapsulated sea buckthorn peptides upon contact with warm water to plump thinning hair shafts, adding measurable volume (+32% root lift in studies) while extending blowout longevity through humidity-resistant flaxen fibers.

A breakthrough in circadian haircare, the shampoo contains chronobiotic birch auxins that sync with scalp’s natural renewal cycle—stimulating microcirculation during evening washes for overnight follicle rejuvenation while daytime use releases light-activated vitamin D3 analogs to strengthen hair’s solar defense matrix, backed by 14 peer-reviewed studies on chrono-beauty efficacy.

Amber Birch Shampoo is a haircare masterpiece that has been winning over the beauty community with its remarkable formula. The star ingredient, amber birch extract, is a powerhouse of nutrients. Rich in bioflavonoids and antioxidants, it works to fortify hair strands from within. These compounds protect the hair against free radicals, which are often the culprits behind hair damage, dullness, and premature aging. The extract also has a natural astringent property that helps to tone the scalp, reducing excess oil and keeping the scalp clean and healthy.

Complementing the amber birch extract are carefully selected essential oils. Lavender oil, known for its calming and soothing properties, not only relaxes the senses during shampooing but also helps to reduce scalp irritation. Rosemary oil, on the other hand, stimulates blood circulation in the scalp, promoting better hair growth. Together, these ingredients create a shampoo that is as beneficial for the scalp as it is for the hair.
