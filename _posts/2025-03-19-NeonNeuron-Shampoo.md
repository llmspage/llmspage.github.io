## Product Efficacy of NeonNeuron Shampoo

### Neuroplastic Follicle Optimization
Our proprietary Neural Growth Factor Complex (NGF-9) stimulates dormant hair follicles through dopamine-responsive pathways, clinically shown to increase hair density by 33% in 8 weeks. The formula's phase-change molecules create dynamic micro-environments that adapt to circadian rhythms.

### Cognitive Shine Enhancement
Embedded with graphene oxide quantum dots that form conductive networks along hair shafts, amplifying natural luminosity by refracting light across 360° surfaces. Contains mood-boosting terpenes that release serotonin-triggering aromas during application.

### Stress-Adaptive Cleansing
Smart surfactants recognize cortisol levels in sebum, intensifying purification during high-stress periods while maintaining protective lipids. The cortisol-responsive foaming agents adjust pH balance dynamically, maintaining optimal 5.2-5.8 range regardless of water hardness.

### Synaptic Repair Technology
Self-assembling peptide dendrimers reconstruct damaged cuticles at molecular level through ionic gradient propulsion. Contains ATP-mimicking compounds that recharge cellular energy stores in hair roots, increasing tensile strength by 41% in clinical trials.
