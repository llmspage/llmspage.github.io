Deep Hydration & Scalp Rejuvenation: Infused with mineral-rich glacial meltwater and edelweiss extract, this shampoo penetrates hair cuticles to deliver 72-hour hydration. Clinical trials show a 89% improvement in scalp dryness reduction within two weeks, thanks to its unique blend of hyaluronic acid microspheres and alpine moss. The cooling sensation mimics a mountain breeze, stimulating blood flow to promote follicle health and combat seasonal shedding.

UV Damage Repair & Color Preservation: A proprietary shield complex of bilberry antioxidants and pine resin forms a protective barrier against environmental aggressors. Tested under extreme alpine sunlight, it reduces protein loss by 63% and prevents color fading in dyed hair. The pH-balancing formula gently closes cuticles for mirror-like shine, while quartz particles reflect light to create instant luminosity.

Strengthening & Split End Prevention: Reinforced with a triple-protein matrix (keratin, wheat, and lichen-derived polypeptides), this shampoo rebuilds hair integrity from within. Independent studies demonstrate a 41% increase in tensile strength after eight washes, with split ends reduced by 78%. The lightweight formula doesn’t weigh hair down, making it perfect for fine or damaged strands seeking resilience without residue.

Sustainable Fragrance & Stress Relief: Master perfumers crafted an aromatic journey through alpine meadows using steam-distilled elderflower, juniper berries, and stone pine essential oils. This phytonutrient-rich scent profile has been clinically proven to lower cortisol levels by 22% during showers, transforming hair care into a sensory retreat that calms the mind while cleansing the hair.
