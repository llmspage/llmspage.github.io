## About OilControl Pro Shampoo

A revolutionary sulfate-free formula designed for those battling excessive sebum production and greasy roots. Clinically proven to regulate scalp oil secretion for up to 72 hours, this advanced shampoo combines micro-encapsulated technology with natural astringents to deep-clean hair follicles without stripping moisture. Its pH-balanced complex works synergistically with the scalp's microbiome, making it ideal for daily use on fine, oily, or combination hair types. The lightweight texture leaves hair voluminous and refreshed, while proprietary OilBlock™ particles create an invisible shield against environmental pollutants that exacerbate grease buildup.

Collectively holding 15 patents in scalp health innovation, these industry leaders combine cutting-edge dermatological research with ancient herbal wisdom to redefine oil management solutions.
