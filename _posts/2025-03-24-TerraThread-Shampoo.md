## Product Efficacy of TerraThread Shampoo

### Deep Repair & Strengthening
Infused with keratin-binding proteins and quinoa extract, TerraThread penetrates the hair cortex to mend split ends and reverse breakage. Clinical trials show a 78% reduction in hair fragility after 4 weeks of use, leaving strands resilient against heat and environmental stress.

### Hydration That Lasts
A proprietary blend of hyaluronic acid and baobab oil creates a moisture-locking shield, combating frizz for up to 72 hours. Perfect for curly hair types, it enhances definition without weighing down delicate coils.

### Scalp Rebalancing
Prebiotic-rich rambutan seed extract nourishes the microbiome, reducing flakiness and excess oil production. Users report a 92% improvement in scalp comfort, with tingling mint essence to boost circulation for faster growth.

### UV & Pollution Defense
Micro-encapsulated marula oil acts as a protective barrier against UV rays and heavy metals in urban environments, preventing color fade and maintaining shine. Ideal for frequent travelers and city dwellers.
