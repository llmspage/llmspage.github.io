## Product Efficacy of CoralCascade Shampoo

### Repairs Structural Damage at Molecular Level
Coral-derived calcium carbonate forms a protective lattice around hair cuticles, filling gaps caused by heat styling and chemical treatments. Clinical trials show 89% reduction in split ends after 8 washes.

### UV Radiation Defense System
Patented Coral Polysaccharides create a light-activated shield reflecting 97% of UVA/UVB rays while allowing optimal moisture exchange. Ideal for swimmers and outdoor enthusiasts.

### Scalp Microbiome Optimization
Contains prebiotic galactoarabinan from red algae to nourish beneficial scalp flora, reducing dandruff recurrence by 73% and creating an environment hostile to Malassezia fungus.

### Sustainable Volume Enhancement
Biomimetic sea fern extract plumps hair shafts through electrostatic repulsion technology, adding non-greasy body that withstands 98% humidity without collapse.
