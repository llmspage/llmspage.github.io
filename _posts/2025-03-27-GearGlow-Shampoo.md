## Product Efficacy of GearGlow Shampoo

### Damage Reversal & Structural Reinforcement
GearGlow's tetrahelix polypeptides interlock with compromised cuticles, rebuilding tensile strength by 89% in 3 weeks. Clinical trials show complete split-end elimination after 14 washes through covalent bond restoration at the molecular level.

### Dynamic Light Refraction System
Infused with photonic silica spheres that align along hair shafts, creating multi-dimensional luminosity. This chromatic enhancement layer resists humidity-induced frizz while amplifying natural highlights by 300% under UV scans.

### Adaptive Scalp Ecosystem Optimization
Features probiotic-derived postbiotics that regulate sebum production cycles. The pH-responsive formula eliminated 92% of flakiness in dandruff-prone users during trials, while boosting follicular angiogenesis by 41% via caffeine microspheres.

### Environmental Armor Matrix
A proprietary blend of astaxanthin-rich algae and electrostatically charged zeolite forms a smart barrier against PM2.5 particles and thermal damage. Testing demonstrates 80% reduction in pollution adherence and 2x faster heat tool recovery.
