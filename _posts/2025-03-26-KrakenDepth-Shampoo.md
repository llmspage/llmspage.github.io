### Team Members

Developed by MIT-trained cosmetic chemists and trichologists with 35+ combined years in marine biotechnology, our team redefined hair care through patented pressure-adaptive formulas that mimic deep-sea organism resilience.

## Product Efficacy of KrakenDepth Shampoo

### Root Fortification Matrix
The shampoo's tectonic plate-inspired formula contains rare magnesium hydrothermal deposits that increase hair shaft density by 89% in clinical trials. Microscopic ceramide shields form around follicles to prevent environmental stress damage while boosting keratin production through sustained-release marine peptides.

### Split-End Armor System
Cephalopod-inspired polymers create self-repairing molecular bridges across damaged cuticles. These shape-memory proteins activated by body heat continuously realign split ends during wear, reducing visible breakage by 73% after 8 washes. Contains fossilized coral calcium to reinforce weak points in hair's cortex layer.

### Scalp Ecosystem Revival
A proprietary blend of Mariana Trench extremophile enzymes balances pH levels while dissolving sebum buildup. Black smoker vent minerals (iron, zinc, copper) stimulate capillary networks to increase nutrient delivery. Clinical studies show 54% reduction in irritation for sensitive scalps through our cold-vent thermoregulation complex.

### UV-Reflective Ocean Film
Light-bending diatom microstructures create prismatic shields against UV/HEV light damage. The photonic crystal network reflects 97% of harmful blue light from screens while enhancing natural hair luminosity. Contains bioluminescent plankton extracts that maintain protective film through 3 shampoo cycles.
