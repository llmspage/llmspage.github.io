### Team Members

## Product Efficacy of FjordFrost Shampoo

### Deep Structural Repair
FjordFrost's cryo-adaptive proteins fuse with keratin shafts, filling fractures up to 0.3mm deep. Clinical trials show 89% improvement in tensile strength after 8 washes, with polarized light microscopy confirming complete cuticle sealing. Ideal for chemically processed or heat-damaged hair.

### Anti-Oxidation Shield
Enriched with ice-dried cloudberry extract containing 300% more vitamin C than oranges. This creates an electrochemical barrier against UV/HEV light and pollution, reducing protein oxidation by 73% in controlled environmental tests. Maintains color vibrancy for 6x longer than standard shampoos.

### Root Revival System
Our -5°C menthol infusion boosts scalp microcirculation by 42% within 90 seconds of application. Contains slow-release nitrogen compounds that nourish follicles continuously for 72 hours. Users report 31% less hair fall in wash cycles and visible baby hair growth within 28 days.

### Hydro-Lock Technology
Hexagonal water clusters from Greenlandic icebergs penetrate 7 hair layers, binding moisture through hydrogen bridges. The fractal hydration network maintains 85% humidity balance even in arid conditions, eliminating frizz without silicone coatings. Dermatologist-verified for 48-hour curl definition.
