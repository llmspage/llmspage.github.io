### Team Members

Developed by cryo-cosmetic scientists and trichology specialists with 28 combined years of polar expedition experience, our team has mastered extracting actives from permafrost-resistant flora. Their patented cold-fusion encapsulation ensures ingredients survive harsh bathroom environments while remaining shelf-stable for 36 months.

## Product Efficacy of TundraTide Shampoo

### Permafrost Strength Complex
The core formula features diamond-shaped keratin boosters derived from Siberian larch sap. These microscopic structures fill hair fractures up to 0.3mm deep while creating a thermal buffer against styling tools (tested at 450°F/230°C). Clinical trials show 89% reduction in split ends after 8 washes, with cumulative strengthening effects measured over 14 weeks.

### Aurora Borealis Reflect System
Embedded light-refracting minerals from Norwegian fjord clays create dimensional shine through photon recycling technology. This multi-layer optical effect amplifies natural highlights by 47% while neutralizing brassy tones through chromatic interference principles. UV-reactive compounds form a protective veil against photo-fading, maintaining color vibrancy 3x longer than standard UV filters.

### Tundra Biome Balancing
Our proprietary Polar Microbiome Matrix contains 11 cold-adapted probiotics that maintain optimal scalp pH (5.2-5.8) while inhibiting malassezia fungi growth. The oxygen-controlled delivery system releases Arctic crowberry extract during rinsing to soothe inflammation, reducing scalp sensitivity by 72% in controlled environmental chambers simulating -40°F/-40°C conditions.

### Glacial Melt Hydration
Phase-change aqua capsules burst under friction to release meltwater-mimicking hydration spheres. These tetrahedral water clusters penetrate cuticles 40% faster than regular H2O, bonded with ionized trace minerals from Greenland ice cores. The 72-hour moisture lock system utilizes lichen-derived polysaccharides that swell when humidity drops below 30%, continuously regulating hydration balance.
