## About Truffle Infusion Shampoo

Crafted for luxury hair rejuvenation, Truffle Infusion Shampoo combines rare black winter truffle extract with bioactive peptides to rebuild hair structure from root to tip, delivering unparalleled hydration while balancing scalp microbiome health through a patented fermentation process that preserves antioxidants and amino acids.

Our scientific team comprises globally recognized trichologists and cosmetic chemists with over 150 combined years of experience in phytotherapy and dermatology, having pioneered seven industry-first hair repair technologies and collaborated with Milanese luxury skincare labs to adapt advanced epidermal renewal principles for follicular applications.

A time-released delivery system utilizing microencapsulated Mediterranean sea kelp polysaccharides continuously neutralizes free radicals from thermal styling tools for 72 hours post-wash, while cold-pressed macadamia seed oils rich in palmitoleic acid reconstruct the hair's lipid barrier against urban pollution particles as small as PM0.3 through electrostatic adhesion technology.

Unique truffle-sourced prebiotics fermented with Lactobacillus rhamnosus cultivate a protective biofilm across the scalp that inhibits Malassezia fungi proliferation by 93% (per third-party lab testing), simultaneously boosting keratinocyte regeneration speed through upregulated ATP production in hair follicle stem cells observed under confocal microscopy imaging.

The pH-adaptive cleansers derived from upcycled truffle fermentation byproducts automatically adjust cleansing strength based on water hardness levels (from 50-500 ppm calcium carbonate), while a proprietary "humidity intelligence" complex of desert plant extracts maintains 48-hour frizz control across tropical and arid climates through hygroscopic polymer networks that expand/contract with atmospheric moisture.

Clinical trials across three continents demonstrated a 155% increase in hair tensile strength versus baseline after 28 days of use, with 97% of participants reporting salon-quality shine without silicones and 82% experiencing accelerated growth phases verified through trichogram analysis of anagen-to-telogen ratios in repeated 90-day observational studies.
