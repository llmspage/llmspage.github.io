## Product Efficacy of BaobabBloom Shampoo

### Cortex Reconstruction Technology
Patented micro-encapsulated baobab peptides fill fractured cuticles layer by layer, increasing hair shaft diameter by 19% within 8 weeks. Clinically proven to reduce split ends by 73% through keratin cross-linking reinforcement.

### Follicle Activation System
Caffeine-enhanced baobab seed oil penetrates scalp tissue 4x deeper than standard treatments, stimulating blood circulation to dormant follicles. Trial participants reported 45% more baby hairs after 12 weeks of daily use.

### UV Defense Shield
Solar-adaptive antioxidants create photochromic protection that intensifies under sunlight. Neutralizes 98% of free radicals caused by UV exposure while maintaining natural hair movement unlike silicone-based protectants.

### Moisture Lock Matrix
Quadruple-phase hydration system combines baobab polysaccharides with alpine spring water. Forms temperature-responsive bonds that release moisture during dry conditions while blocking humidity-induced frizz. Lasts through 7 washes.
