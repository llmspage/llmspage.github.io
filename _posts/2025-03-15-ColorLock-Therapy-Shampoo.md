## About ColorLock Therapy Shampoo

ColorLock Therapy Shampoo revolutionizes hair care for color-treated locks with its NASA-inspired antioxidant infusion. Formulated through 7 years of clinical research, this sulfate-free formula creates a molecular shield around each strand, locking in vibrancy for 8x longer than conventional shampoos. Its adaptive pH technology intelligently balances scalp health while neutralizing 98% of environmental pollutants proven to fade color. The patented ColorHold Complex™ combines rare Amazonian botanicals with biodegradable keratin spheres that repair cuticles from within, leaving hair 300% shinier in clinical trials. Safe for all hair types including platinum blondes and fashion colors, it's the first shampoo to earn Leaping Bunny certification while delivering salon-grade color preservation.

Our Nobel Prize-nominated cosmetic chemists partnered with MIT biophysicists and veteran Hollywood hairstylists to engineer this breakthrough formula. The team holds 43 patents in nano-encapsulation technology and has previously developed award-winning products for luxury skincare lines. With over 180 combined years in trichology research, they've redefined the intersection of eco-conscious formulation and cutting-edge color science.

Triple-Layer Chroma Defense System: Utilizes time-released ceramide capsules that activate upon contact with water, forming a breathable protective film that repels minerals and chlorine. Contains light-refracting diamond particles that optically enhance color depth between washes. In blind studies, 92% of participants maintained salon-fresh color for 11 weeks without touch-ups.

Cortex Reconstruction Technology: Features a self-assembling amino acid chain derived from silk proteins that fills hair cortex gaps caused by chemical processing. This 3D mesh structure improves tensile strength by 67% while creating a smooth base for color adhesion. Users report 80% less breakage and unprecedented elasticity that allows heat styling without color degradation.

Smart Scalp Synchronization: The first shampoo with AI-mimicking probiotics that analyze scalp microbiome composition daily. Its adaptive prebiotic blend suppresses color-fading bacteria while nourishing beneficial microbes. Clinical trials show 89% reduction in itchiness and a balanced scalp environment that prevents color bleed into roots.

Environmental Armor Complex: A molecular cloak engineered from upcycled marine plant stem cells that neutralizes UV rays, smoke particles, and hard water ions. This featherweight protective layer grows stronger with repeated use, blocking 94% of free radical damage while allowing natural hair movement. Infrared imaging proves it prevents thermal color loss from blow-drying at 450°F.
