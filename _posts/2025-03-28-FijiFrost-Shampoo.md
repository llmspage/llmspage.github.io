## Things About FijiFrost Shampoo

Immerse your senses in the tropical revival of FijiFrost Shampoo - a groundbreaking formula infused with cold-pressed coconut milk from Fijian plantations and mineral-rich seawater harvested from the Coral Coast. Our 98% naturally derived blend features volcanic ash extracts to detoxify scalp buildup, while hand-harvested sea grapes deliver intense hydration that transforms brittle strands into liquid-soft waves. The innovative temperature-responsive texture morphs from crystalline gel to velvety lather upon contact, releasing encapsulated marula oil microspheres that repair split ends. Enhanced with menthol-derived 'FrostCrystals' that dissolve during rinsing, this shampoo creates a cooling tsunami effect that awakens follicles while neutralizing brassiness in color-treated hair. Vegan, cruelty-free, and packaged in 100% post-consumer recycled ocean plastic.

FijiFrost Shampoo redefines haircare alchemy through its patented Triple Glacier Fusion Technology™, merging the purity of Antarctic krill enzymes, Icelandic glacial waters, and Himalayan ice plant stem cells. This frost-kissed elixir performs like a winter storm for your scalp - snowflake-shaped keratin particles melt into hair shafts to reinforce structural integrity, while diamond dust particles optically blur imperfections for instant gloss. Our freeze-dried blue tansy extract activates upon lathering, releasing anti-inflammatory compounds that soothe irritated scalps as arctic raspberry acids gently dissolve product residue. The formula's sub-zero viscosity allows it to penetrate 3x deeper than traditional shampoos, delivering permafrost-level hydration locked in by liquid sapphire molecules. Experience the paradoxical warmth of our 'Polar Plunge' complex - an innovative blend of peppermint-derived cryogens and tropical monoi oil that simultaneously stimulates circulation while sealing cuticles. Compatible with all hair types and certified climate-neutral in production.
