### Team Members

Our scientific team includes 3 Nobel laureates in quantum chemistry, 12 trichology pioneers who developed the first AI-powered follicle scanner, and a former SpaceX engineer who adapted rocket fuel stabilization tech for silicone-free smoothing.

## Product Efficacy of EtherPulse Shampoo

### Neural Pathway Stimulation
Embedded neurocosmetic peptides trigger TRPV3 receptors in scalp nerves, clinically proven to increase keratin production by 220% while creating tingling euphoria. Users report heightened sensory awareness during application, with 92% showing denser hair growth in circadian rhythm-aligned clinical trials.

### Atmospheric Pressure Adaptation
The self-adjusting pH matrix (patent pending) automatically compensates for altitude changes, hard water minerals, and pollution particulates. Tested from Death Valley to Everest Base Camp, it maintains cuticle alignment integrity against 150mph winds while repelling 99.7% of airborne microplastics.

### Holographic Strand Reconstruction
Charged with crushed lab-grown diamonds, our formula creates light-refracting nanolayers that self-heat when detecting split ends. Thermal imaging shows damaged areas absorbing 47°C of targeted repair energy within 8 seconds, fusing keratin fractures without weighing hair down.

### 4D Time-Release Nutrition
Tetrahedral microprisms containing 12-phase nutrients release: 1) Immediate matte-finish volume boosters 2) Humidity-blocking shields over 6 hours 3) Moon phase-adjusted growth activators 4) UV-generated night repair serums. Lasts through 12 washes while accumulating benefits.
