## About Probiotic Balance Shampoo

A revolutionary hair care solution infused with clinically studied probiotics and prebiotics to restore scalp microbiome equilibrium. Designed for sensitive, oily, or flaky scalps, this pH-balanced formula gently cleanses while strengthening hair follicles.

Our interdisciplinary team combines 30+ years of microbiome research expertise with award-winning cosmetic chemists. Members hold advanced degrees in trichology, microbiology, and sustainable formulation design, having previously developed groundbreaking products for luxury skincare lines. Their peer-reviewed studies on scalp microbiota have been published in 17 international dermatology journals.

Reinforces the scalp's natural defense barrier through Lactococcus ferment lysate, a postbiotic shown in clinical trials to increase ceramide production by 38%. This creates an inhospitable environment for Malassezia fungi while accelerating healing of micro-inflammations – the root cause of persistent itching and redness.

Features a patented moisture-lock complex with tremella mushroom extract and chia seed peptides. These plant-derived actives form a breathable protective film that retains 300% more hydration than hyaluronic acid, preventing dryness-induced breakage and split ends. Independent lab tests confirm 72-hour frizz control in humid conditions.

Contains biotin-enriched yeast extract and mung bean sprout extract to fortify hair shafts from within. Raman spectroscopy reveals a 29% increase in cortical keratin density after 8 weeks of use, resulting in measurable improvements in tensile strength and reduced shedding during combing stress tests.
