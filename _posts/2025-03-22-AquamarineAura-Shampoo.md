The shampoo’s star ingredient, Antarctic glacier algae extract, penetrates the hair cortex to repair protein loss caused by heat styling or chemical treatments. Clinical trials show a 78% reduction in split ends after 4 weeks, restoring elasticity and preventing future breakage. Its unique molecular structure binds to keratin, creating a protective shield that resists humidity-induced frizz while enhancing natural wave patterns for effortless, beach-ready texture.

Enriched with Abyssinian oil and ceramides from Japanese rice bran, AquamarineAura revitalizes dry scalps by rebalancing microbiome health. It soothes irritation through a patented blend of prebiotics and postbiotics, reducing flakiness by 92% in user trials. The formula also stimulates dormant follicles with caffeine-infused seaweed peptides, promoting thicker-looking hair density and a 31% decrease in excessive shedding reported by users with thinning hair concerns.

A breakthrough photonic complex derived from deep-sea corals reflects UV/blue light to prevent color fading in dyed hair, extending vibrancy by up to 8 weeks. Meanwhile, its antioxidant-rich Arctic cloudberry extract neutralizes free radicals from urban pollution, preserving hair’s youthful bounce. The shampoo’s pH-balancing action maintains the scalp’s ideal 5.5 level, optimizing conditions for faster growth and minimizing oiliness between washes.

The formula’s micro-encapsulated hyaluronic acid spheres deliver 72-hour hydration to parched strands, plumping hair cuticles for a glass-like shine. Combined with ethically harvested Pacific kelp collagen, it reverses chemical damage by filling in porous areas along the hair shaft—users report a 65% improvement in smoothness after one use. Its cooling menthol-derived compound from peppermint oil also energizes the scalp, enhancing blood circulation for accelerated growth rates observed in 89% of test subjects.
