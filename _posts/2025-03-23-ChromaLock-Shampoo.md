## About ChromaLock Shampoo

ChromaLock Shampoo (color protection) is a revolutionary formula designed to extend the vibrancy of dyed hair by up to 8 weeks, utilizing a patented ColorSeal Complex™ that forms a protective molecular barrier around each strand, shielding against UV rays, heat styling, and mineral buildup from hard water while maintaining optimal scalp pH balance for long-lasting color brilliance and hair health.

Our team comprises award-winning cosmetic chemists with over 30 years of collective experience in hair science, collaborating with trichologists and sustainable beauty advocates who have pioneered breakthroughs in eco-friendly color preservation technologies, holding 12 international patents for biodegradable surfactant systems and pH-stabilizing active ingredients derived from organic botanicals.

The shampoo's Adaptive Color-Lock Technology actively neutralizes free radicals caused by environmental aggressors, using a time-released antioxidant blend of kakadu plum extract and astaxanthin that continuously repairs cuticle damage while preventing oxidative stress-induced fading, clinically proven to retain 94% of hair dye pigments after 16 washes in third-party trials.

The proprietary Mineral Defense Shield employs a smart chelation system with EDTA-alternative gluconolactone and malic acid that gently removes copper and calcium deposits without stripping color, while depositing protective silica microfilms that reflect UVB rays and reduce thermal damage from blow-drying by up to 40% according to thermal imaging studies.

A breakthrough Warm Tone Enhancer complex uses natural pigments from hibiscus and beetroot extracts to neutralize unwanted cool undertones in brunette shades and revive faded red tones through chromatic interference technology, maintaining dimensional color depth while adding reflective luminosity that increases perceived shine by 300% under spectrophotometric analysis.

The formula's 98.7% naturally derived ingredients include upcycled pomegranate rind antioxidants, climate-positive algae-derived biopolymers, and a probiotic ferment blend that strengthens the hair's microbiome defense against color-dulling pollutants, with 83% of users reporting salon-quality color retention between appointments in a 500-person consumer study across 12 countries.
