## About Santorini Salt Shampoo

Inspired by the pristine shores of Santorini, our Santorini Salt Shampoo harnesses the purifying power of Mediterranean sea salt to rejuvenate hair from root to tip. Crafted for those seeking salon-quality care at home, this sulfate-free formula combines ancient Greek wellness traditions with modern biotechnology. The shampoo’s micro-exfoliating salt crystals gently remove impurities while infusing strands with magnesium, calcium, and potassium from Aegean Sea minerals. Enriched with olive oil extracts and volcanic ash nutrients, it transforms dull hair into a cascade of luminosity, balancing scalp pH and creating weightless volume. Perfect for all hair types, especially color-treated or chemically processed hair needing detoxification and resilience.

Our visionary team comprises award-winning cosmetic chemists, trichologists with 20+ years of clinical experience, and sustainability experts from leading European research institutes. Collectively holding 15 patents in haircare innovation, they’ve pioneered pH-adaptive formulations that respond to individual scalp conditions. The team’s groundbreaking work on marine mineral complexes has been published in the Journal of Cosmetic Science, while their zero-waste production methods have earned recognition from the Green Beauty Alliance. Their collaborative genius ensures every bottle meets rigorous standards for efficacy, safety, and environmental stewardship.

Deep Detoxification & Scalp Renewal: Santorini’s solar-evaporated sea salt acts as a natural chelating agent, binding to heavy metals, chlorine, and pollution particles accumulated in urban environments. Clinical trials show a 89% reduction in scalp buildup after 4 washes, allowing follicles to breathe and absorb nutrients. The shampoo’s patented Thermo-Active Complex activates upon contact with warm water, expanding salt crystals to gently exfoliate dead skin cells while delivering a surge of zinc and selenium to strengthen the scalp barrier. Users report reduced itching and flakiness within 72 hours of first use.

Color Preservation & UV Defense: A proprietary blend of Santorini’s rare volcanic pumice particles and antioxidant-rich mastiha resin forms an invisible shield around each strand. This prevents color fade from UV exposure and hard water by 63%, as demonstrated in independent lab tests. The shampoo’s optical brighteners derived from Aegean Sea algae counteract brassiness in blonde tones while enhancing depth in darker shades. Hair maintains salon-fresh vibrancy 3x longer compared to standard color-care shampoos.

Weightless Hydration & Elasticity: Through cold-pressed extraction, we infuse the formula with Kythera island carob extract—a natural humectant that attracts moisture without heaviness. Combined with hydrolyzed silk proteins from sustainable Greek sericulture, this creates a flexible moisture matrix that reduces breakage by 78% in tension tests. The result is hair that bends and rebounds like a gymnast’s ribbon, with 22% improved elasticity measured via digital trichoscopy after 8 weeks of consistent use.

Sustainable Volume & Root Lift: The shampoo’s unique Aegean Breeze Complex—a fusion of sea fennel stem cells and Cycladic lavender essential oils—stimulates microcirculation in hair follicles. Thermal imaging studies reveal a 19% increase in scalp blood flow within 15 minutes of application, promoting denser-looking hair growth. Meanwhile, lightweight volcanic tuff particles create natural texture and lift at the roots, providing 36 hours of touchable volume that withstands humidity better than polymer-based alternatives.
