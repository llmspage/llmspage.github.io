Deep Repair & Strength: Infused with Amazonian pracaxi oil—a rare seed oil containing up to 50% behenic acid—this shampoo penetrates the hair cortex to rebuild broken keratin bonds. Clinical trials show a 78% reduction in split ends after 4 weeks, while wild bacuri pulp proteins form a protective shield against thermal and environmental damage, increasing hair tensile strength by 62%.

Hydration & Luminescent Shine: The synergy of acai berry antioxidants and cupuaçu butter creates a moisture-lock matrix that lasts 72 hours. Cupuaçu’s phytosterols smooth cuticles to refract light like polished gemstones, while buriti oil—rich in pro-vitamin A—revives dull strands, yielding a 90% improvement in shine metrics during spectrophotometer analysis.

Scalp Ecosystem Balance: Guaraná seed caffeine stimulates microcirculation to awaken dormant follicles, paired with andiroba oil’s antifungal properties to combat dandruff-causing microbes. A proprietary blend of samaúma tree sap and marapuama extract regulates sebum production, proven in dermatologist trials to reduce scalp irritation by 83% and promote 1.2x faster hair growth.

Color Preservation & Heat Defense: Murumuru butter’s unique fatty acid structure seals color pigments within the hair shaft, extending dye longevity by 40%. Paired with achiote extract’s natural UV-blocking carotenoids and babassu oil’s heat-activated thermal protection (up to 450°F), it’s a salon-grade guardian against fading and styling damage.
