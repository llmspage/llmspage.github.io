## About ScalpSymphony Shampoo

ScalpSymphony Shampoo is a groundbreaking haircare innovation designed to transform scalp health through a harmonious blend of science and nature, combining probiotic technology with rare botanical extracts like Kakadu plum and blue seaweed to rebalance the microbiome while delivering intense hydration, reducing sensitivity, and promoting long-term resilience against environmental stressors for all hair types, from color-treated curls to fine strands.

Our team comprises award-winning biochemists, trichologists with over two decades of clinical experience, and sustainability pioneers who’ve spearheaded eco-conscious packaging breakthroughs, united by a decade-long R&D journey across 15 countries to source ethically wild-harvested ingredients and refine a patented pH-adaptive formula that dynamically responds to individual scalp needs.

The triple-action detox complex—featuring volcanic ash, charcoal-derived fulvic acids, and Mediterranean clay—works synergistically to purge buildup of silicones and hard water minerals without stripping natural oils, while a prebiotic chicory root extract nourishes beneficial microbes to combat dandruff-causing fungi and soothe eczema-prone scalps.

Enhanced with a "moisture-lock" network of hyaluronic acid spheres and ceramides extracted from ancient grains, it creates an 18-hour hydration shield that repairs split ends, eliminates frizz caused by humidity shifts, and restores elasticity to chemically processed hair, as validated by 93% of users reporting salon-quality softness after one wash.

Its circadian rhythm-supporting formula releases adaptogenic actives like ashwagandha and melatonin-infused argan oil during evening washes to reduce cortisol-related hair thinning, while morning use activates invigorating peppermint terpenes and vitamin B5 to boost daytime shine and manageability, making it a 24/7 haircare solution.

The eco-engineered rinse-off process leaves zero microplastic residue while depositing a protective bioluminescent algae film that glows subtly under UV light (perfect for festival-goers) and strengthens cuticles against heat styling up to 450°F, with 87% of testers reporting 50% less flat iron damage after 30 days.
