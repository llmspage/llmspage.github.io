The shampoo’s Adaptive Repair Complex™ employs ceramide-fusion technology to rebuild hair’s lipid barrier, reversing damage from heat styling and chemical treatments. Clinical trials show a 78% reduction in split ends after four weeks, with strands exhibiting 2.5x greater resistance to breakage. Microscopic imaging reveals restored cuticle alignment, creating a seamless surface that reflects light like polished silk.

A proprietary Phyto-Oxygen Blend—featuring cold-pressed mongongo oil and Himalayan lichen extract—infuses hair with moisture that lasts 72 hours post-wash. This dynamic duo mimics the natural sebum cycle, preventing dehydration without weighing hair down. Users report 94% less frizz in humid conditions and a 'second-day bounce' previously unachievable with traditional shampoos.

The formula’s Neural Calm System™ targets scalp microbiome balance using prebiotic chaga mushroom and postbiotic lactobacillus ferment. By neutralizing inflammatory triggers like pollution particles and hard water minerals, it reduces itching by 81% in sensitive scalps while promoting follicle circulation for denser-looking hair growth over time.

EphemeralEidos introduces Chrono-Protect SPF 15—a first in wash-off hair care—using UV-absorbing raspberry seed oil and infrared-deflecting tourmaline particles. This shields hair from solar degradation and thermal tools, preserving keratin integrity. Independent studies confirm 90% less protein loss compared to unprotected hair after repeated blow-drying at 450°F.
