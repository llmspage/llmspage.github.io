## Product Efficacy of SupernovaSilk Shampoo

### Nebula-Infused Strand Reinforcement
Clinical trials show 89% reduction in split ends after 4 weeks through our patented Supernova Particle Fusion™ – microscopic silica matrices fill hair cortex voids while emitting negative ions to seal cuticles. Enhances tensile strength by 300% compared to standard keratin treatments.

### Interstellar Color Preservation
Photon-reflective ceramides create an electromagnetic shield against UV/thermal damage, maintaining vibrancy 8x longer. Tested on 50 shades from platinum to ebony, demonstrating 94% color retention through 30 washes. Contains cosmic dust extracts rich in rare-earth minerals for depth-enhancing luminosity.

### Black Hole Purification Technology
Our quantum-charged charcoal complex acts as a microscopic vacuum, removing 99.7% of pollutants (PM2.5, heavy metals, free radicals) while preserving scalp microbiome. The helical brush applicator tip stimulates acupressure points to boost circulation by 40% during application.

### Dark Matter Root Volumizing
NASA-derived aerogel particles expand upon drying, creating lift that lasts 48 hours through humidity fluctuations. Contains gravitationally-aligned bamboo cellulose fibers that build architectural support at the follicle level, increasing root elevation by 2.8mm in 90% of users.
