## Product Efficacy of ObsidianNoir Shampoo

### Dual-Action Scalp Revival
Micro-encapsulated salicylic acid penetrates hair follicles to dissolve sebum buildup while cold-pressed buriti oil forms a protective barrier against urban pollutants. Clinical trials show 89% reduction in scalp irritation after 4 washes.

### Cortex Reinforcement System
Our proprietary keratin-binding peptide complex (KBP-7®) reconstructs damaged hair shafts at molecular level. Independent lab tests demonstrate 300% improvement in tensile strength and complete repair of split ends within 28 days of regular use.

### Chromaphore Lock Technology
Light-reflecting mineral complexes derived from Andean obsidian stones create permanent color protection for treated hair. Maintains 98% of salon dye vibrancy while preventing brassiness in blonde tones through UV-reactive pigments.

### Adaptive Hydration Matrix
Smart moisture spheres respond to humidity levels - releasing desert date extract in arid conditions while activating water-resistant marula oil in tropical climates. 24-hour frizz control verified under 7 climate zone simulations.
