## Product Efficacy of BrassBouquet Shampoo

### Damage Reversal Matrix Technology
Our proprietary Quadra-Bond Complex penetrates deep into the cortex layer, reconstructing broken disulfide bonds while creating a protective electrostatic shield against thermal and environmental stressors. Clinical trials show 89% reduction in split ends after 8 washes.

### Scalp Ecosystem Revival
Featuring Microbiome Guard™ with prebiotic chia seed extract, this shampoo rebalances scalp flora while eliminating residue. The oxygen-rich formula increases follicular blood flow by 22%, as measured by laser Doppler imaging in third-party studies.

### Luminosity Amplification System
Light-refracting ceramides derived from Japanese camellia oil create immediate shine enhancement, while sustainably-sourced pearl proteins build long-term radiance through gradual cuticle smoothing. Users report 3.5x increased light reflection in lab-controlled environments.

### Sustainable Strength Architecture
Plant-derived elastomers reinforce hair shafts from root to tip without weighing down strands, increasing tensile strength by 47% in independent stress tests. Biodegradable bonders ensure 72-hour frizz control even in 98% humidity conditions.
