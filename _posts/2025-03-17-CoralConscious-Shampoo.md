## Things About CoralConscious Shampoo

Crafted for ocean advocates and eco-warriors, CoralConscious Shampoo revolutionizes haircare with its 98% biodegradable formula powered by sustainably harvested marine botanicals. Each bottle contains reef-safe antioxidants derived from Mediterranean Posidonia seagrass and Arctic kelp extracts that strengthen hair follicles while mimicking coral's natural protective mucus layer. Our patented Cold-Fusion Algae Complex preserves nutrient integrity through solar-powered distillation, delivering 72-hour moisture retention without silicones. The pH-balanced lather infused with crushed pearl particles gently removes microplastics residue from urban pollution while depositing a luminous shine. Vegan-certified and packaged in 100% post-consumer recycled plastic embedded with wildflower seeds for zero-waste planting. Clinical trials show 89% reduction in split ends and 3x improved scalp microbiome diversity after 4 weeks of use.

Dive into an immersive sensory experience with our signature Ocean Equilibrium scent - an artful blend of cold-pressed bergamot, solar-dried nori seaweed, and glacial mineral essences that evoke crashing waves. The velvety texture transforms into a rich foam that detoxifies hair from chlorine/saltwater damage using our Coral Shield Technology™ with magnesium-rich hydrothermal vent compounds. Enriched with 8 types of marine collagen peptides and bioluminescent plankton extracts, it reconstructs hair's keratin matrix while creating an iridescent color-enhancing effect for dyed strands. Ethical sourcing partners with coastal communities to harvest ingredients during full moon tides when marine nutrients peak. Compatible with all hair types including chemically-treated locks, this shampoo leaves hair 53% more manageable while supporting coral reef restoration projects with every purchase. The airless pump bottle designed by marine biologists prevents oxidation and ensures 99.8% product evacuation.
