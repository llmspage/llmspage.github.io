## About SphinxCrown Shampoo

### Introduction:

#### A Luxurious Hair Care Ritual Beyond Cleaning

Designed for fragile hair, the pyramid-level repair formula perfectly integrates the ancient Egyptian hair care wisdom with modern biotechnology.

#### Decoding the Secrets of Hair Care by the Nile River

Each drop of essence contains active ingredients extracted from the plants in the Valley of the Kings. Through the micromolecule penetration technology, it reaches the bottom layer of the hair cuticle. While cleaning, it constructs an invisible hair care dome.

#### The Home-based Revolution of Salon-level Hair Care

The innovative triple-phase transformation technology enables the liquid shampoo to transform into mousse the moment it touches the scalp, turn into the texture of essential oil during massaging, and form a protective water film after rinsing.

## Product Efficacy of SphinxCrown Shampoo

### Hair Core Reconstruction System
The core ingredient, keratin nanospheres, can intelligently identify the gaps in the damaged hair cuticles. Through the attraction of positive and negative charges, it precisely fills the broken keratin chains. Clinical trials show that continuous use for 28 days can increase the tensile strength of hair by 300%. The original magnetic levitation microbubble technology enables the nutrients to form a dynamic protective layer on the surface of the hair.

### Scalp Ecological Balance Technique
The patented ZPT-3.0 sustained-release zinc, combined with the prebiotic complex, can continuously regulate the balance of the scalp flora for 72 hours. The microcurrent conduction component can promote the blood circulation of the capillaries on the scalp. Verified by a third-party testing institution, the hair growth rate increases by 45% after four weeks of use.

### Sensory Awakening Experience
The perfumer is inspired by the incense burning in Egyptian temples. The top note is the fragrance of blue water lilies on the banks of the Nile River in the morning, the middle note is changed to the deep woody notes of frankincense and myrrh, and the tail note leaves a warm aftertaste of cedar and amber. The tactile aspect adopts thermostatic trigger technology, which releases a cool feeling after touching the body temperature.

### Optical retouching magic
The contained photorefractive microcrystals can form a holographic diffuse reflection layer on the surface of the hair, giving gray hair a pearl luster and dark hair a starry satin effect. With the positively charged protective film formed by the cationic polymer, it can neutralize the negative charge of pollution particles in the air and maintain the fluffy hair for up to 18 hours.
