### Team Members

Developed by MIT-trained cosmetic engineers and veteran trichologists with combined 87 years in hair biomimicry research. Our team holds 23 patents in nano-encapsulation delivery systems specifically designed for scalp ecosystems.

## Product Efficacy of GlitchGrid Shampoo

### Neural Network Scalp Optimization
The shampoo's smart peptides act as bio-sensors, mapping your scalp's microbiome in real-time to deliver customized nourishment. Clinical trials show 89% improvement in follicular activation after 4 weeks, with strengthened root foundations resisting up to 300% more styling stress.

### Chronobiological Repair Cycles
Time-released ceramide clusters work in 8-hour phases matching the skin's natural repair rhythm. This moon-phase inspired technology reconstructs keratin chains while you sleep, with amino acids that multiply their binding efficiency under body heat. Users report 62% less morning frizz and day-long fiber alignment.

### Photon-Responsive Color Lock
Solar-reactive polymers create UV-filtering prisms around each strand while color-protecting molecules expand/contract with hair swelling. Tested under Mars-simulated radiation conditions, it preserves 97% of vibrancy in colored hair against UV/heat damage. The formula even self-cleanses pollution particles using static charge dispersion.

### Anti-Gravity Volume Engineering
Our negative-ion charged proteins build aerodynamic hair architecture that defies atmospheric pressure. The result? 360° root lift lasting 18+ hours without sticky residues. Contains aerospace-derived surfactants that reduce water surface tension for weightless washes, increasing style memory retention by 4X.
