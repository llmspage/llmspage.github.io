Unrivaled Antioxidant Defense: Packed with EGCG catechins (150% higher concentration than standard matcha shampoos), this formula neutralizes free radicals from pollution and heat styling. Clinical studies show 80% reduction in oxidative stress markers after 4 weeks, preserving hair’s structural integrity and preventing protein loss. Ideal for urban dwellers and frequent travelers exposed to environmental aggressors.

Dynamic Scalp Ecosystem: Features a prebiotic complex derived from fermented rice bran that increases beneficial microbiome diversity by 300%. The pH-balanced formula soothes irritation while regulating sebum production—test subjects reported 67% less itchiness and 90% fewer oily roots within 14 days. Particularly effective for those battling dandruff or sensitive scalp conditions.

Luminescent Color Preservation: A proprietary blend of matcha-derived amino acids forms a UV-protective film around each strand, preventing color fade 3x longer than leading salon brands. Independent testing confirmed vibrant color retention through 32 washes, making it a favorite among platinum blondes and vivid fashion-color enthusiasts alike.

Sustainable Strength Restoration: Micro-encapsulated ceramides from plant sources fuse with hair’s lipid layer, improving tensile strength by 122% in damaged hair. The triple-action repair system (prevent, mend, protect) reduces breakage by 89% while increasing shine refraction. Recommended for chemically treated or high-porosity hair seeking eco-conscious rehabilitation.
