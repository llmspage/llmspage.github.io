## Product Efficacy of CyberSlick Shampoo

### Dynamic Strand Reinforcement
Proprietary fractal polymers branch into hair fissures at the molecular level, increasing tensile strength by 300% while maintaining natural flexibility. Clinical trials show 89% reduction in split ends after 28 days of use.

### Smart Scalp Synchronization
Enzyme-triggered delivery system releases customized concentrations of zinc pyrithione, salicylic acid, and prebiotics based on real-time sebum levels detected by our conductive gel matrix. Maintains optimal scalp pH between 4.5-5.5 regardless of environmental stressors.

### Photonic Color Preservation
Chromatic-stabilizing compounds neutralize color-fading free radicals generated by screen emissions. Proven to extend dyed hair vibrancy by 6-8 weeks compared to conventional color-safe formulas through photon absorption technology.

### Neural Detox Activation
Our patented cerebro-cosmetic complex stimulates scalp circulation through neurotransmitter-mimicking peptides, accelerating toxin removal while enhancing nutrient delivery to follicles. MRI scans demonstrate 42% increased blood flow post-wash.
