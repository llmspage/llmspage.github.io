## About Coral Reef Shampoo

Introducing Coral Reef Shampoo, a revolutionary hair care formula inspired by the resilience and vitality of ocean ecosystems, blending sustainably sourced marine botanicals like red algae extract, kelp collagen, and coral calcium to strengthen hair fibers while mimicking the pH balance of seawater for ultimate scalp harmony—this vegan, cruelty-free formula is packaged in 100% recycled ocean-bound plastic and leaves hair with a luminous, saltwater-kissed texture without dryness or residue.

Our team comprises award-winning marine biologists, cosmetic chemists with 20+ years in luxury hair care, and sustainability experts who’ve pioneered zero-waste manufacturing processes; collectively, we’ve spent over a decade researching coral-safe ingredients and developing proprietary extraction methods that preserve marine biodiversity while delivering salon-quality results.

The formula’s antioxidant-rich coral peptides and astaxanthin from Arctic seaweed create a protective shield against UV radiation and pollution, slowing color fading in dyed hair by 40% and neutralizing free radicals that cause premature aging of strands, leaving hair visibly thicker and glossier—even under harsh sunlight or urban smog.

A breakthrough in scalp microbiome balance, this shampoo features prebiotic-rich oceanic enzymes that nourish beneficial bacteria while gently dissolving product buildup and excess sebum with its mild, sulfate-free lather, making it ideal for sensitive scalps prone to irritation or dandruff, with 92% of test users reporting reduced itchiness and flakiness within 14 days.

The invigorating scent profile, crafted by master perfumers using only ECOCERT-approved fragrances, captures the essence of a thriving reef—top notes of bergamot and sea spray blend with heart notes of solar-bleached driftwood and night-blooming cereus, anchored by base notes of ambergris and vetiver for a sophisticated, gender-neutral aroma that lingers subtly for 12+ hours.

Coral Reef Shampoo’s cold-processed blend of ethically harvested Wakame seaweed (rich in vitamins B5 and E) and upcycled oyster shell nanoparticles works synergistically to boost hair elasticity by 31% in independent lab tests, while its biodegradable formula breaks down safely in marine environments—proven to cause no harm to coral larvae in third-party ecotoxicity studies.
