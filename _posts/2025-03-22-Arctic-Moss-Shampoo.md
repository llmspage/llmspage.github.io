Arctic Moss Shampoo is a game - changing haircare product that harnesses the power of nature's most resilient ingredients. Sourced from the frigid yet pure landscapes of the Arctic, arctic moss takes center stage in this remarkable formula.

Arctic moss is a wonder ingredient rich in unique nutrients. Its high - content of bioactive compounds, including flavonoids and antioxidants, works to fortify hair from the root to the tip. These antioxidants combat oxidative stress, which is a major cause of hair damage. By neutralizing free radicals, they prevent hair from becoming dull, brittle, and prone to breakage. The flavonoids in arctic moss also have anti - inflammatory properties, making them excellent for soothing an irritated scalp.
