## Product Efficacy of SavannahSilk Shampoo

### Deep Reconstruction Therapy
SavannahSilk's patented keratin-silk fusion penetrates the hair cortex, repairing up to 97% of split ends within 8 washes. Clinical trials show a 45% increase in tensile strength while maintaining natural flexibility, preventing breakage from root to tip.

### UV Defense Shield
Enriched with marula oil antioxidants, this formula creates an invisible protective barrier that blocks 92% of UVB rays and environmental pollutants. Users report 73% less fading in color-treated hair and significantly reduced dryness in arid climates.

### Scalp Rejuvenation
A cooling baobab extract complex stimulates microcirculation, reducing flakiness by 89% in dandruff-prone scalps. The lightweight moisturizing system balances sebum production, extending freshness for 72+ hours without residue buildup.

### Thermal Armor Technology
Heat-activated argan peptides form a breathable protective layer during styling, reducing heat damage from blow-drying by 68% at 450°F. Ideal for frequent heat users, it maintains style longevity while preventing protein degradation.
